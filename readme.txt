Overview

This assignment uses the values that were stored in MongoDB by the APIs created in Assignment8.
When the application is started, the user is directed to a login page.
There are 3 pre-stored values in the MongoDB collection which can be used for login. Any other value would throw an error.
Once the user is logged in, he will be navigated to the Home Page which contains a nav bar and card with data.
From the nav bar, the user can move through the other pages.
All the pages follow a similar structure.
The Jobs page has a list of jobs which are dynamically rendered by the react map() feature. The job details are stored in an array which is then read by the map and rendered on the page.
